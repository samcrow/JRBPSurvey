Jasper Ridge Survey privacy policy

Last updated: 2021-10-28

Information collected

When you use the Jasper Ridge Survey application, it collects the following information:

* Your name, the tablet ID, the route name, and the sensor ID that you enter when starting a route
* The date and time of each sensor placement and sensor pickup event that you enter
* The date, time, route name, ant species, and any notes you enter for every observation
  that you record

The application uses your location only to display it on the map. The application never
sends your location information off the device it is running on.

Information handling

The information collected is stored in a database accessible to a few people who
manage the survey process. We use the information to verify the integrity of
the observations, and we may contact users to ask questions about the observations
they have entered.

Information about which species were found at different survey locations may be
shared publicly and analyzed. This shared information does not include your name or
any other personally identifying information.
