The Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve ant survey regularly surveys the species of ants in each of
hundreds of locations across the preserve. This application helps people navigate to the correct
locations, identify ants, record observations, and upload them to a central database.

Note: This application is intended only for registered volunteers participating in the ant survey.
